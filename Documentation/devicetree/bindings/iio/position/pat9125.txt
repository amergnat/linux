Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "pixart,pat9125"
	- reg: i2c address where to find the device
	- interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
	interrupt client node bindings.

Example:

pat9125@75 {

	reg = <0x75>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
	interrupts = <12 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
};
